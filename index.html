<h1>What we did</h1>
<center><h2 style="color:white;">So basically, the plan was to make a remote controler for a blimp so we had to get the remote to control the servos which would control the propellers.</h2></center>
<h1>How it worked?</h1>
<center><h2 style="color:white;">So to code everything we used the micro.bit website. We got it to work in a way where which ever way the micro.bit point, the servos would move in that direction.</h2></center>
<h1>The troubles we had</h1>
<center><h2 style="color:white;">We had a few troubles here and there but the main problem we had was to get the microbit to move the servos in the direction that you want it to.</h2></center>
